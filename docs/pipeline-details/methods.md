Trimmed reads are then aligned to the human hg38 reference genome using BWA mapping software (v. 0.7.17)[^2]. Duplicate reads are marked using Samblaster (v. 0.1.25)[^3] and sorted using samtools (v. 1.8). Finally, base quality score recalibration is performed as indicated in the GATK4 (v. 4.2.2.0) best practices [^4].## Germline variant callingHaplotypeCaller from GATK4 (v. 4.2.2.0) is used to call germline variants, parallelized across chromosomes, and all samples in the cohort are joint genotyped together [^4]<sup>,</sup>[^5].## Somatic variant callingSomatic variant calling (SNPs and Indels) is performed using Mutect (v. 1.1.7)[^6], Mutect2 (GATK v. 4.2.0)[^7], Strelka2 (v. 2.9.0)[^8], and VarDict (v. 1.4)[^9] in tumor-normal mode. Variants from all callers are merged using the CombineVariants tool from GATK version 3.8-1. Genomic, functional and consequence annotations are added using Variant Effect Predictor (VEP v. 99)[^10] and converted to Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) using the vcf2maf tool (v. 1.6.16)[^11].For Copy Number Variants (CNVs), Control-Freec (v. 11.6)[^12] is used to generate pileups, which are used as input for the R package 'sequenza' (v. 3.0.0)[^13]. The complete Control-Freec workflow is then re-run using ploidy and cellularity estimates from 'sequenza'.## FFPE Artifact filteringSOBDetector is a tool that scores variants based on strand-orientation bias, which can be a sign of DNA damage caused by fixation of tissue. This pipeline runs SOBDetector in a two-pass method.  The first pass uses parameters provided with the software (calculated from publicly available data from TCGA), then cohort-specific bias metrics are computed from those results, and SOBDetector is re-run using these cohort-specific values.## Quality and identity metricsAncestry and relatedness scores are generated using Somalier (v. 0.2.13)[^14]. Contamination analyses are performed against viral and bacterial genomes from NCBI using Kraken2 (v. 2.1.2)[^15], as well as against mouse, human, and UniVec databases using FastQ Screen (v. 0.14.1)[^16].  Sequence, mapping and variant statistics are computed using FastQC (v. 0.11.9), Qualimap (v. 2.2.1)[^17] and SNPeff (v. 4.3t)[^18]. All of these metrics are combined into an interactive HTML report using MultiQC (v. 1.11)[^19].## Pipeline OrchestrationJob execution and management is done using Snakemake (v. 6.8.2)[^20] using custom-built Singularity (v. 3.8.5) containers for reproducibility.## References[^1]: Bolger, A.M., M.
